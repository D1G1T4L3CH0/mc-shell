mc-shell
========

Minecraft server remote shell (bash script) for linux to start, stop, restart, and update the server as well as a few other things.

I'm (D1G1T4L3CH0) still a bit new to bash scripting so this script likely looks like a mess with a lot of dumb ways of doing things. You are free to help out with this and add to it or create forks.
